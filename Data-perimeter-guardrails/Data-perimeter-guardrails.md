## Data perimeter guardrails

* A **data perimeter** is a set of preventive guardrails in your AWS environment you use to help ensure that only your trusted identities are accessing trusted resources from expected networks. Data perimeter guardrails are meant to serve as always-on boundaries to help protect your data across a broad set of AWS accounts and resources. These organization-wide guardrails do not replace your existing fine-grained access controls. Instead, they help improve your security strategy by ensuring that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, roles, and resources adhere to a set of defined security standards.

* **Trusted identities**: Principals (IAM roles or users) within your AWS accounts, or AWS services acting on your behalf.

* **Trusted resources**: Resources owned by your AWS accounts or by AWS services acting on your behalf.

* **Expected networks**: Your on-premises data centers and virtual private clouds (VPCs), or networks of AWS services acting on your behalf.

*  **Policies** : Please visit [data perimeter repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/data-perimeter-policy-examples) for policy examples.
