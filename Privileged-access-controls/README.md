Enforce controls to make sure that your roles and applications are given only privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.

| Included Policy | Rational | 
|------|-------------|
|[Prevent root credentials management in member accounts in AWS Organizations.](Prevent-root-credentials-management-in-member-accounts-in-AWS-Organizations.json) | Centrally manage root access for member accounts in [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/). Only allow management account sessions to be able to perform actions on root credentials. Note: An SCP restricts permissions for IAM users and roles in member accounts, including the member account's root user. SCPs have no effect on users or roles in the management account.|
|[Deny the root user from performing actions other than modification to S3 bucket policy](Deny-the-root-user-from-performing-actions-except-S3-bucketpolicy-changes.json)| Consider configuring an administrative user in [AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to perform daily tasks. Restrict use of root user with exceptions for S3 bucket policy changes, if you are frequently locked out of S3 buckets. Refer to [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)|
|[Deny modifications to specific IAM roles](Deny-modifications-to-specific-IAM-roles.json)|Restrict IAM principals in accounts from making changes to specific IAM roles created in an AWS account. This could be a common administrative IAM role created in all accounts in your organization.| 
|[Deny critical IAM user actions](Deny-critical-IAM-user-actions.json)| Restrict creation and modification of IAM user profiles, IAM user access keys, service specific credentials such as Amazon Bedrock API keys and account password policy to a privileged role, or principal with the `IAMUserManagementException` Principal tag set to a value of `true`.|

It doesn't block existing direct access or any access that routes through your on-premises network environment.Note: Existing VPCs that have internet access retain their internet access.|
|[Deny Amazon Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections](Deny-Amazon-Virtual-Private-Network(VPN)-connection-creation-modification-deletion.json)|Restrict creation, modification or deletion actions on Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections (Site-to-Site VPN and Client VPN) to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).|
